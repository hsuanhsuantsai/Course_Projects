If you have any question concerning the codes, feel free to let me know.


1. Enter "make" in the command line and ocr is the default target for Makefile

2. This program can be run on dataset/image library with the same format as MNIST dataset/image library. (Naming format must be exactly the same!)

3. How to run the program:
	./ocr [train-name] [train-size] [test-name] [k] [distance-scheme]

	For example,
	With train-images-idx3-ubyte and train-labels-idx1-ubyte as training dataset, t10k-images-idx3-ubyte, t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte as test dataset in the same directory

	./ocr train 15000 t10k 5 euclid

4. For input options:
	-If train-size is 0, the program will use all images from the training dataset.
	-If "all" is specified for train-size, the program will use 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of images in the training dataset.
	-If "all" is specified for k, the program will set k to 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20.
	-If "all" is specified for distance-scheme, the program will be run with every implemented distance function.

5. Output format
	-Every second:
	[distance scheme] images processed/total training images (ratio) numbers of correct classification/images processed (ratio)
	-Final output:
	#distance   k       train-size
	scheme-name k-value accuracy

6. design choices
	-Make a function call LIST(&s) from distance file, which can return a string of all schemes available and the number of valid schemes.
	 I separate each scheme by a blank, which can be detected by a parser-like manner.
	 In this case, if we have return string with blanks separating each scheme, we can build a scheme_list with known s.
	-Hardcode all_train_size and all_k because they are the requirement of the assignment and are not flexible.
	-We want to analyze the performance of different scheme under THE SAME subset, so I choose to build them up at first. I put train_size selection in the inner part of for loops.
	-I wanted to reduce the redundency of my code and tried to build up a selection function and a print out function. However, after considering code readability I decide to list all the cases, which is an easier way to read the code.
	-I want to use one dimension array to store knn results.(trying to reduce complexity of my code) Thus, I have to put my all_train_size selection in the innermost loop. Because we want to have the output format like this:
	 # distance k 15000 30000
     euclid 1 50.34 60.33
     euclid 5 53.34 79.22
